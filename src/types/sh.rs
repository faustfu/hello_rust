// 1. like tuple, use struct to group relative information.
// 2. structs without field names are tuple structs.
// 3. struct could have no any fields. (utility object)
// 4. struct fields could be a reference with lifetime settings.
// 5. Methods of the struct can take ownership of self, borrow self immutably as weâ€™ve done here, or borrow self mutably,
//    just as they can any other parameter.
// 6. Rust automatically adds in &, &mut, or * so object matches the signature of the method.
// 7. Associated Functions: functions defined in a struct, but don't need a struct instance to work.
