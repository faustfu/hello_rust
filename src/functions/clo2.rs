// 1. closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions.
// 2. Closures can capture values from the scope in which theyâ€™re defined.
// 3. Closures are used for the cases which want to seperate executions from initial processes.
// 4. Type annotations are optional for closures if compiler could inferer types from their usage.
