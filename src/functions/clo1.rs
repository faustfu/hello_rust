// How a value is captured by a closure will imply the same set of borrow rules weâ€™re used to in Rust.
// 1. If by reference, then other references can live concurrently with the closure.
// 2. If by mutable reference, then as long as the closure is alive, no other references to the values can exist.
//    However, once the closure is dropped, other references can exist again.
// 3. If by value, then the value cannot be used by anything ever again.
//    (This automatically implies that the closure owns the value.)
// 4. If by reference(mutable or not), lifetime of the reference should be longer than the closure's.
// 5. Using the move keyword like this moves all captured variables into the closure,
//     and therefore they cannot be used after the closure.
// 6. Closures will preferentially capture by immutable reference, then by mutable reference, and only then by value.
// 7. To solve lifetime issues, we can force a closure to capture by value with the move keyword.
// 8. Regarding the traits of closures:
//    a. If a closure uses anything by value, then the closure is a FnOnce.
//    b. Otherwise, if a closure uses anything by mutable reference, then the closure is a FnMut,
//        which automatically implies FnOnce as well.
//    c. Otherwise, a closure is a Fn, which automatically implies both FnMut and FnOnce.

// normal functions, returning values depend on parameters.
