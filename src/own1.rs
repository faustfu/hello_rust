// Ownership is a way of using stack to replace garbage collection or record count to manage allocated memory space.

// Ownership starts off with the following rules:
// 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.(binding)
// 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
// 3. When the owner goes out of its scope, the binded value will be dropped if it is not a return value(move).
// 4. A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. 
// 5. Borrow: get the reference of the owner for accessing the actual value.
// 6. If the borrowing is readonly, it will not do any data races.
// 7. The lifetime of the value always outlives the references to it.
// 8. If the ownership is transfered. New owner could decide the value's mutation state.
// 9. A value could be clone(unknown size in heap)/copy(known size in stack) to avoid ownership transfering(move) issue. But it has cost.

  // uses_foobar(x); //the statement is invalid, because the value is used here after move

    println!("Before y");
